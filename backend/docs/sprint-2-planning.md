### Integration Patterns

#### Event-Driven Communication
```python
# Organization events that affect departments
OrganizationActivatedEvent → Department.activate_all_departments()
OrganizationDeactivatedEvent → Department.deactivate_all_departments()
OrganizationSettingsUpdatedEvent → Department.update_constraints()
OrganizationDeletedEvent → Department.handle_organization_deletion()

# Department events that affect roles
DepartmentCreatedEvent → Role.create_default_department_roles()
DepartmentDeletedEvent → Role.cleanup_department_roles()

# Role events for audit and monitoring
RoleAssignedEvent → Audit.log_role_assignment()
RoleRevokedEvent → Audit.log_role_revocation()
```

#### Service Dependencies
```
Organization Service (Sprint 1) ←─ Department Service (Sprint 2)
                ↑                           ↑
                └───── Role Service (Sprint 2) ──────┘
```
