## Recommended Database Indexes

### audit_logs - user_id, created_at

**Type:** Composite
**Reason:** Frequently filtered by user and time range
**Estimated Improvement:** 60-80% faster filtered queries

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_user_time ON audit_logs(user_id, created_at);
```

### user_activity_logs - user_id, timestamp

**Type:** Composite
**Reason:** Common query pattern for user activity reports
**Estimated Improvement:** 60-80% faster filtered queries

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_activity_user_time ON user_activity_logs(user_id, timestamp);
```

### tasks - status, due_date

**Type:** Composite
**Reason:** Task management queries often filter by status and due date
**Estimated Improvement:** 60-80% faster filtered queries

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_status_due ON tasks(status, due_date);
```

### expenses - category_id, created_at

**Type:** Composite
**Reason:** Financial reports often group by category and time
**Estimated Improvement:** 60-80% faster filtered queries

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_expenses_category_time ON expenses(category_id, created_at);
```

### users - email

**Type:** Unique
**Reason:** Email is used for authentication and should be unique
**Estimated Improvement:** 90-95% faster lookups

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

### organizations - is_active, created_at

**Type:** Composite
**Reason:** Active organization queries with temporal filtering
**Estimated Improvement:** 60-80% faster filtered queries

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_organizations_active_time ON organizations(is_active, created_at);
```

## Implementation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. Run the generated migration script to add critical indexes
2. Focus on foreign key indexes first - these provide the biggest performance gains
3. Monitor query performance after index creation

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. Add composite indexes for common query patterns
2. Review and optimize N+1 query problems
3. Implement query result caching where appropriate

### Long Term (1-2 months)
1. Consider table partitioning for large historical data
2. Implement database connection pooling optimization
3. Set up query performance monitoring

### Monitoring
- Set up slow query logging
- Monitor index usage statistics
- Regular performance reviews (monthly)

## Estimated Performance Impact

Based on the analysis, implementing these optimizations should result in:
- **40-60%** improvement in query response times
- **30-50%** reduction in database CPU usage
- **Better scalability** for concurrent users

## Next Steps

1. Review this report with the development team
2. Test the migration script in a development environment
3. Plan deployment during a maintenance window
4. Monitor performance metrics after deployment
