# Issue: Department Service Phase 2 - 階層構造拡張とTask Management統合

## 📋 **Issue Summary**

**Title:** Department Service Phase 2 - Hierarchical Structure Enhancement and Task Management Integration

**Priority:** High  
**Sprint:** Phase 2 Sprint 2  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days  
**Dependencies:** PR #94 (Task Management Service)

## 🎯 **Objective**

Enhance the Department Service with advanced hierarchical management capabilities and integrate with the newly implemented Task Management Service to provide comprehensive organizational structure support.

## 📖 **Background**

With the completion of the Task Management Service (PR #94), we now need to enhance the Department Service to:
1. Support complex hierarchical organizational structures
2. Integrate with task management for department-level task organization
3. Provide advanced permission inheritance capabilities
4. Enable cross-department collaboration workflows

## 🔧 **Technical Requirements**

### 1. **Hierarchical Structure Enhancement**
- Implement materialized path pattern for efficient hierarchy queries
- Add depth-based queries and constraints
- Support department tree operations (move, restructure)
- Implement circular reference detection

### 2. **Permission Inheritance System**
- Department-level permission inheritance
- Role-based access control integration
- Permission scope management
- Inheritance chain validation

### 3. **Task Management Integration**
- Department-level task organization
- Task permission inheritance
- Department task reporting
- Cross-department task collaboration

### 4. **Advanced Collaboration Features**
- Department collaboration agreements
- Resource sharing mechanisms
- Cross-department workflows
- Approval and authorization systems

## 🏗️ **Implementation Plan**

### Phase 2.1: Core Hierarchical Structure (Day 1)
- [ ] Enhance Department model with hierarchy fields
- [ ] Implement materialized path operations
- [ ] Add department tree management methods
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite

### Phase 2.2: Permission Inheritance (Day 2)
- [ ] Implement permission inheritance logic
- [ ] Add role-based permission checks
- [ ] Create permission scope management
- [ ] Test permission inheritance chains

### Phase 2.3: Task Management Integration (Day 3)
- [ ] Integrate with Task service
- [ ] Add department task queries
- [ ] Implement task permission inheritance
- [ ] Create department task reporting

### Phase 2.4: Collaboration Features (Day 4)
- [ ] Implement department collaboration model
- [ ] Add collaboration workflows
- [ ] Create approval mechanisms
- [ ] Test cross-department functionality

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### Unit Tests
