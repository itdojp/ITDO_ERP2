# PR #94 Final Status Report - Task Management Service Implementation

## 🎯 Sprint 2 Day 1 CI修正とマージ準備完了

### ✅ **CI Issue Resolution (COMPLETED)**

**Problem Identified:**
- Task model import error in CI test environment
- Missing Task model in conftest.py imports
- Tasks table not included in test cleanup order

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. **Fixed conftest.py imports:**
   ```python
   # Before
   from app.models import Department, Organization, Permission, Role, User
   
   # After  
   from app.models import Department, Organization, Permission, Role, Task, User
   ```

2. **Updated table cleanup order:**
   ```python
   table_order = [
       "user_roles",
       "role_permissions", 
       "password_history",
       "user_sessions",
       "user_activity_logs",
       "audit_logs",
       "project_members",
       "project_milestones",
       "tasks",  # ← Added for task management cleanup
       "projects",
       "department_collaborations",
       "users",
       "roles", 
       "permissions",
       "departments",
       "organizations",
   ]
   ```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Task model imports successfully: `from app.models import Task`
- ✅ Database tests pass: 8/8 department hierarchy tests passing
- ✅ No SQLAlchemy model registration errors
- ✅ Test cleanup works correctly with foreign key constraints
