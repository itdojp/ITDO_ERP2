    **Key Features:**
    - Multi-provider support (Stripe, PayPal, GMO Payment, etc.)
    - Real-time fraud detection and risk scoring
    - Automated capture for low-risk transactions
    - PCI DSS compliant token handling
    - 3D Secure and CVV verification
    - Comprehensive audit logging

    **Processing Flow:**
    1. Create transaction record
    2. Assess fraud risk (0-100 scale)
    3. Block high-risk transactions (score > 80)
    4. Authorize payment with provider
    5. Auto-capture for amounts < Â¥100,000
    6. Complete transaction and logging

    **Error Handling:**
    - Card declined: Returns specific error codes
