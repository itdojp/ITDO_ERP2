## Optimization Recommendations

### High Priority
- **Autoscaling**: Implement predictive auto-scaling based on historical patterns
  - Impact: 30-40% cost reduction during off-peak hours ($800/month savings)
  - Implementation: Configure HPA with custom metrics and scheduled scaling

- **Build_Cache**: Implement multi-layer build caching strategy
  - Impact: 50-70% reduction in build times
  - Implementation: Configure Docker layer caching and dependency caching

- **Parallel_Builds**: Enable parallel builds for independent components
  - Impact: 40-60% reduction in total build time
  - Implementation: Configure GitHub Actions matrix builds and parallel stages

### Medium Priority
- **Spot_Instances**: Use spot instances for non-critical workloads
  - Impact: 50-70% cost reduction for batch processing ($1200/month savings)

- **Incremental_Builds**: Implement incremental builds to avoid rebuilding unchanged code
  - Impact: 60-80% reduction in build times for small changes

- **Deployment_Strategy**: Implement blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
  - Impact: 100% uptime during deployments

### Low Priority
- **Reserved_Capacity**: Purchase reserved instances for predictable workloads
  - Impact: 30-60% cost savings with 1-3 year commitment ($2000/month savings)
