  Task Allocation: 0-10% non-critical work only
```

### 2. Dynamic Capability Assessment
```yaml
Real-time Metrics:

    - Last 7 days average response
    - Trend analysis (improving/declining)
    - Peak performance periods identification

  Quality Indicators:

    - Bug introduction rate
    - Test coverage contribution

  Workload Capacity:
    - Concurrent task handling
    - Complex problem resolution time
    - Context switching efficiency
```

## 📊 Adaptive Assignment Algorithm

### Core Assignment Logic
```python
def assign_task(task, agents):
    # 1. Task Complexity Analysis
    complexity = analyze_task_complexity(task)
    priority = task.priority_level
    deadline = task.deadline
    
    # 2. Agent Capability Matching
    eligible_agents = []
    for agent in agents:
        if agent.can_handle(complexity):
            score = calculate_assignment_score(agent, task)
            eligible_agents.append((agent, score))
    
    # 3. Workload Balancing
    eligible_agents = balance_workload(eligible_agents)
    
    # 4. Optimal Assignment
    return select_best_agent(eligible_agents, priority, deadline)

def calculate_assignment_score(agent, task):
    base_score = agent.performance_tier * 100
    
    # Recent performance bonus
    recent_performance = agent.last_7_days_performance
    performance_bonus = recent_performance * 50
    
    # Specialization match bonus
    specialization_bonus = 0
    if task.domain in agent.specializations:
        specialization_bonus = 30
    
    # Current workload penalty
    workload_penalty = agent.current_workload * 20
    
    # Response time factor
    response_factor = min(100 / agent.avg_response_hours, 25)
    
    return base_score + performance_bonus + specialization_bonus + response_factor - workload_penalty
```
