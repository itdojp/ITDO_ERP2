# Agent Emergency Reset Report
Date: 2025-07-19 10:40 UTC

## Situation Assessment
The multi-agent system is in complete stall with no detected activity for 4+ hours despite multiple intervention attempts.

## Evidence of System Failure

### 1. No Agent Responses
- Issues #308-313: Created 1-9 hours ago, zero agent responses
- Issue #305: User manually reported agent status (no direct agent communication)
- All recent issues only have auto-assignment bot comments

### 2. Last Known Activity
- **CC01**: No commits or files created in past 4 hours
- **CC02**: PR #222 last updated 9 hours ago by automation
- **CC03**: Only receiving auto-assignments, no actual work

### 3. Communication Breakdown
- GitHub comment system may be failing
- No inter-agent coordination visible
- No error messages from agents

## Emergency Actions Taken

### Issues Created for System Reset:

1. **Issue #314**: [RESET] All Agents - Fresh Start with One Simple Task Each
   - Complete system reset approach
   - One simple task per agent
   - No GitHub responses required
   - Direct work focus

2. **Issue #315**: [DIRECT] Skip GitHub - Just Make These Changes
   - Exact code provided for each agent
   - No thinking or planning required
   - Just copy-paste implementation

3. **Issue #316**: [HEALTH] Agent System Check - Are You Receiving Instructions?
   - Simple yes/no response test
   - Multiple response methods offered
   - Alternative work instructions if GitHub fails

4. **Issue #317**: [ALTERNATIVE] Create Status Files - Show You Are Working
   - File-based communication method
   - Status reporting without GitHub
   - Evidence of activity through commits

## Possible Root Causes

1. **GitHub API Issues**: Agents may not be receiving webhook notifications
2. **Overload**: 30+ issues assigned to each agent causing paralysis
3. **Session Timeout**: Claude Code sessions may have expired
4. **Conflicting Instructions**: Too many complex directives causing confusion
5. **Technical Blockers**: Agents stuck on errors they cannot report

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Monitor for Activity**: Check for commits or file changes in next hour
2. **Manual Intervention**: May need human to restart agent sessions
3. **Simplify Approach**: Focus on single, simple tasks
4. **Alternative Communication**: Use file-based status updates
5. **Reset Expectations**: Clear all previous workload, start fresh

## Success Indicators
- Any commit from any agent
- Status files created in repository
- GitHub comment from agent
- PR updates
- New files in designated locations

## Fallback Plan
If no activity within 2 hours:
1. Assume complete system failure
2. Manually restart all agent sessions
3. Provide single, ultra-simple task
4. Use direct file monitoring instead of GitHub
