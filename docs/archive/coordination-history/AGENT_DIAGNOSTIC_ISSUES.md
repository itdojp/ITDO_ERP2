# Agent Diagnostic Issues - Created 2025-07-18

## Summary
Created four diagnostic issues to understand and address the current agent system restrictions and workflow problems.

## Issues Created

### 1. Issue #278: [ALL AGENTS] System Diagnostic - Security Restrictions Analysis
- **URL**: https://github.com/itdojp/ITDO_ERP2/issues/278
- **Purpose**: System-wide diagnostic for all agents to report their status
- **Labels**: cc01, cc02, cc03, bug
- **Focus**: Understanding capabilities, restrictions, and workarounds

### 2. Issue #279: [CC01 DIAGNOSTIC] Security Restriction Analysis and Workaround
- **URL**: https://github.com/itdojp/ITDO_ERP2/issues/279
- **Purpose**: CC01-specific analysis of security restrictions
- **Labels**: cc01, bug
- **Focus**: Detailed error analysis and alternative approaches

### 3. Issue #280: [CC02 SUPPORT] PR #222 CI Failure Analysis and Recovery
- **URL**: https://github.com/itdojp/ITDO_ERP2/issues/280
- **Purpose**: Support CC02 with failing PR #222
- **Labels**: cc02, bug
- **Focus**: CI failure analysis and recovery planning

### 4. Issue #281: [CC03 WORKFLOW] Auto-Assignment System Analysis and Task Distribution
- **URL**: https://github.com/itdojp/ITDO_ERP2/issues/281
- **Purpose**: Analyze CC03's auto-assignment pattern and workload
- **Labels**: cc03, bug
- **Focus**: Workload distribution and team coordination

## Key Approach
All issues focus on:
- **Analysis and Reporting** rather than attempting restricted actions
- **Understanding Restrictions** to find appropriate workarounds
- **Collaboration Strategies** to work within current constraints
- **Documentation** of specific errors and patterns

## Next Steps
1. Wait for agent responses to diagnostic requests
2. Analyze patterns in restrictions across all agents
3. Develop appropriate workaround strategies
4. Consider manual intervention where necessary
5. Document successful recovery patterns for future reference

## Recovery Priority
1. **Immediate**: Get diagnostic reports from all agents
2. **Short-term**: Address CC02's PR #222 CI failures
3. **Medium-term**: Redistribute CC03's workload
4. **Long-term**: Establish sustainable workflow patterns

## Success Metrics
- Agents provide detailed diagnostic reports
- Clear understanding of restrictions and capabilities
- Identification of viable workarounds
- Improved task distribution
- Successful CI/CD pipeline recovery
