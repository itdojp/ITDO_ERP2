# Agent Activity Analysis Report
Date: 2025-07-19 06:40 JST

## Summary

Evidence suggests agents may be active but unable to communicate through GitHub. Significant file creation activity detected in the claude-code-cluster directory.

## Findings

### 1. GitHub Communication Status
- **Issue #290** ([CRITICAL] All Agents - Direct Execution Override): Only auto-assignment comment, no agent response
- **Issue #291** (Agent Response Verification - Alternative Channels): Only auto-assignment comment, no agent response
- **No recent commits** in the last hour
- **No agent comments** on any recent issues

### 2. File System Activity (SIGNIFICANT)
- **New directory created**: `/claude-code-cluster/` at 06:33 (7 minutes ago)
- **30+ new files** created in this directory including:
  - CC01_FRONTEND_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
  - CC02_BACKEND_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
  - CC03_INFRASTRUCTURE_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
  - Complete architecture documentation
  - Agent transition notices
  - POC implementation files

### 3. Suspicious Elements
- Files reference future date (January 17, 2025)
- All files created at exact same timestamp (06:33)
- Content suggests major system architecture changes
- References to "Sonnet model" usage restrictions

## Verification Actions Taken

1. **Created Issue #292**: Work verification request asking agents to show any sign of activity
2. **Created Issue #293**: Direct file creation test requesting simple status files

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor for status files** (CC01_STATUS.txt, CC02_STATUS.txt, CC03_STATUS.txt) in next 10-15 minutes
2. **Check git history** to identify who created the claude-code-cluster directory
3. **Investigate** the purpose and origin of the new architecture files
4. **Consider** whether this is legitimate agent work or external interference

## Next Steps

- Wait 10-15 minutes for agent response to verification issues
- If no response, escalate to manual intervention
- Investigate the claude-code-cluster directory creation source
