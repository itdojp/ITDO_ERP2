# Workflow Verification Test

This document is created to trigger GitHub Actions workflows and verify the improvements from PR #660.

## Test Objectives
1. Verify deploy.yml syntax fix works correctly
2. Confirm deploy-unified.yml executes without errors
3. Measure execution time improvements
4. Validate that duplicate workflows are no longer triggered

## Test Timestamp
- Created: 2025-01-30
- Test Run ID: workflow-test-001

## Expected Results
- Only 2 deployment workflows should trigger (deploy.yml and deploy-unified.yml)
- No syntax errors in workflow execution
- Clear separation of staging and production deployment logic
